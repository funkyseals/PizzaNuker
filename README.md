## A nuke bot for Discord
An easy to use nuke bot code for Discord, you can branch it and add what you want, but please don't make a branch of this of this if you aren't gonna change anything.

### Download
Download from bot.py from GitHub,
> If you haven't already, download python from python.org.
> Download pip too.
Go to your terminal and run these commands:
> pip install keyboard
> pip install discord
(The reason you have to get keyboard is because I make the terminal fullscreen on startup, press f11 again to go back to windowed)
(If you dont like that, download botnokbmodule.py instead.)
Then go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/
Make an application, then go to the bots tab and make a bot.
Copy the bot token.
Open the python program you downloaded in a text editor (literally anything, even Notepad.)
Replace "Put your token here!" with your token (Do NOT remove the quotation marks.)
Go to the OAuth2 tab and get the OAuth2 link for your bot, make sure it has administrator priviledges and all the Privileged Gateway Intents.
Put the bot in the server you want to nuke.
Run the python program.
Type pnuke to nuke the server.
